# Recipe Box
### Apollo GraphQL Web Application for TheMealDB
#### TheMealDB: https://www.themealdb.com/
----
Hello there! This is the frontend for my Recipe Box app. I am doing two things with this web app:
* Building on my knowledge from [my last Apollo server](https://github.com/willowell/Apollo-GraphQL-Server-for-REST-Countries).
* Working on [this project](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Recipe-App.md) for my portfolio.

----
#### Features
* (TODO) Adheres to Standard JS.
* (TODO) Fully typed with TypeScript and `@graphql-codegen`.
* Lodash because I love functional programming.
* reach-router
* React Bootstrap
* Uses a Material Design color palette - [see here](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0&secondary.color=E040FB&primary.color=691b99&secondary.text.color=000000)!
----
#### Environment Details
* NodeJS version: 14.4.0
* npm version: 6.14.5
* yarn version: 1.22.4
